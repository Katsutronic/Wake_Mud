  Ogres are by far the most massive of races towering over even the Vithe by more than a foot.  A typical ogre has a greenish grey skin tone which tends on a whole to lean towards dusky color.  Their hair follows suit ranging from an ash color to a green tinted black, which tends to fade into a faint mossy color as they age.  Ogre eyes are an odd set of colors spanning the full gambit even further than those of the humans, reds, greens, blues, white, black, grey, even straying into purples and yellows.  Ogre physiology is similar to that of humans but amplified, the average ogre weighing nearly twice that of a human.  While not violent by nature Ogre's are fiercely territorial and will go to virtually any length to remove a perceived threat from any area which they feel they have claim to.  The ogre's worship the spirits inherent in all things with different classes and types of spirits to determine the being's power. These spirits vary from simple spirits found in stones and grass which lack the power to affect the living world, the next level of spirits are large plants and other inanimate objects which grow more powerful over time but still typically remain separate from the mortal world, the third grade of spirits are animals and weaker humans while not necessarily more powerful than the second class they do tend to interact more with the world of the living, the fourth class of spirits are elemental spirits which never have possessed a physical form are not beholden to the laws which govern the mortal world.  The fifth class of spirit is a spirit which has shed its mortal form and transitioned into the ability to take a new physical form. The priestly hierarchy is fairly flexible with a few fairly powerful elders loosely governing the wide ranging priests.
