  <p class="date">Humans in Elantar</p>
  <p class="content"><span class="title"><strong>101</strong></span><strong><br>
    </strong> 
    <p class="content">Originally the human race was nomadic, inhabiting the eastern forests and grasslands of the continent.  Primarily functioning as hunter/gathers and herders the humans face only one major enemy on and off, the race of the Algid, living in relative peace with their northern neighbors aside from the sporadic winter raids. The first unification of the human race began circa 1000 BCE when the Algid launched their first unified attack.  The resulting 15 year extended raids forced the nomadic humans into a loose federation fleeing the Algid forces, this culminated in the events of Human calendar year 0 where in the human federation was cornered against the northern bank of the Serigon river.  On the brink of destruction the human race was saved from extinction by the fall of a massive meteor between the humans and the algid army.  The meteors fall resulting in the origin of the first human state built by the fall site the construction of the first human city began with the coming of spring organized by a man named Eson, a prince of one of the human tribes who had been granted visions of the meteor&rsquo;s impact, the secondary affect of these visions was the first unified belief system by the human race, a monotheistic religion based on the worship of a fire god whom the humans believed sent the meteor.  There was a 20 year period of fevered building in which the human populace enjoyed a favorable climate and a lack of algid hostilities enabling them to construct the majority of their walled city.  This period of peace ended in human calendar year 20 wherein strange weather phenomena marked the end of the warm season and resulting in the long winter and the winter war. The winter war marks the first siege in human history.  The siege went badly until Eson emerged with the fire sword, with the high priest wielding fire magic on an epic scale.  The emergence of these two marked a turning point in the siege.  The siege culminated with the conflict between the high priest and the algid warlord.  With the destruction of both the priest and the warlord the algid returned to the north, where a second period of favorable weather graced the humans for an extended period.  The peaceful reign of Eson continued unabated for eighteen more years until Eson&rsquo;s son Darien mounted the northern campaign in an attempt to rid the northern border of algid raids, this attempt ended in disaster in human calendar year 43 when Darien fell pray to an algid ambush in what would later be named butchers pass.  During the ambush Eson&rsquo;s two other sons were killed and Darien returned to the human capital without his eyes.  This motivated Eson to move his court north to the city of Skothgard for the remaining years of his life where he continued to do battle with the algid raiders. In the human calendar year 59 Eson died of natural causes.  On the first day of spring his body was laid to rest outside the human capital in a massive tomb.  The funeral of Eson has yet of be equaled by any fallen king yet, while the attendance of Dwarven and Elven emissaries is a common practice Eson&rsquo;s is the only to include an algid delegation, placing a freshly bloodied sword into the coffin as a measure of respect to the fallen.  The reign of king Darien otherwise know as the blind king began shortly after in the largest arms race the human race has ever seen.  Between the years 60-67 the size of the human army more than quintupled, its ranks swelling not only with human recruits but also mercenaries from the other races.  In a move than nearly bankrupted the human kingdom the blind king launched an invasion of the northlands.  This attempt ended in failure with the last message from the blind king&rsquo;s force being received in 68, having produced only a single sickly heir the kingdom fell to the regency of the church.  The progeny of the line of human kings continued only in a puppet manner through the following years with the power of the church gaining an every expanding hold over the human nation, culminating in the human calendar year 193 with the Grand Hierophant Edransian Lucaron.  Lucaron began the acts of purification amongst the human race where in the church began the active persecution of eradication of heretics within its borders, while at the same time restricting trade and emigration by its traditional allies within the other races.  While Lucaron&rsquo;s efforts did maximize the churches hold over the human race it did raise moral issues with some of the more far flung nobles, who felt that the church imposed taxes failed to support the military strength needed on the northern border.  This resulting in the rebellion lead by General Feldith Skothrain in the human calendar year of 207, General Skothrain was a member of the traditionalist faction within the house of knights.  The traditionalist faction was principally based of northern nobles who spent the majority of their time fighting with the algid raiders, and whom felt that the nation had strayed to far from its original intentions, those being the preservation of all humans, and their protection from the physical threats of the algid nation.  The year 208 saw the formation of the Human kingdom of Skothgard, named for and based out of Eson&rsquo;s northern court city.  With the large emigration of soldiers to the new northern kingdom the church began a downward trend; most notable during this period was the marked increase in the use of inquisitors on a wide scale, in an attempt to quell any further rebellions amongst its nobles.  This resulting in a prolonged dark age in human history, until the Shadow war of 495.  In year 495 of the human calendar widespread panic hit the continent as a new invader appeared from the south, lasting only 2 years the Shadow war was fought against a hither to yet un-named foe who arrived en-masse from across the sea causing widespread chaos in the human and Elven kingdoms, resulting in the exodus of the Daurin from the Elven homeland and their subsequent inhabitation of the desert area to the west of the human lands.  With the possibility of future invasion by this new race on the horizon the Church realized the need to open the borders of the human kingdom to strengthen ties with its allies.  In human calendar year 502 the Grand Hierophant Doferai Rhavcaris opened the borders of the human kingdom to the Dwarven, Daurin, and Elven races once more, and halted the use of the inquisitors.  With the influx of other races a new age of enlightenment began, catapulting Human society out of the pits of the Dark Age into modern society.  This amalgam of various cultures brought the Daurin concept of elect government to the younger nobles of the Human court who by popular notion revolted against the church government in the human calendar year of 595 in the  self named &ldquo;Peoples war of popular government&rdquo; securing for their new nation the majority of the western kingdom bordering the Great divide and the Daurin nation.  The Democratic republic of Allied states was officially convened for its first session on midsummer&rsquo;s day  in the year 625.    From this point forward the church&rsquo;s power faced a steady decline, while still retaining roughly one half its original landmass the holy kingdom only controlled a third of the human population.  This number continued to shrink as the church&rsquo;s power did resulting in an all time low of twenty-five percent in the human calendar year 895.  The year 896 however marked the first full scale invasion of the algid people in 850 years, and for the first time since the war of shadows all eyes were on the holy nation.  This presented the Human king, who had only played a puppet role the opportunity to take a forward stage in the affairs of his nation.  Leading the combined armies of the world in an attempt to stop the invasion the Flame king Halcanon held the algid at Maldon cross on the old highroad for nearly two months in during the winter of 896.  He then shattered the algid army in the following months as an early spring stranded and killed the vast majority of his foes.  Returning to the Capitol as a triumphant hero, Halcanon began the long process of recovering his kingdom from the church.  Halcanon was unable to complete his goal by his death in 919, he did however become the first foreign official to ever enter into negotiations with the algid between the years 897 and 912 he received several nonaggression pacts from the algid protecting multiple sites of religious and historical importance.  The final recovery of the holy nation from the church was accomplished in 925 by Halcanon&rsquo;s son Jasten.  During the rule of Jasten the population of the holy kingdom nearly tripled, its control over the human population making a 15% gain in the 25 years following the war.  The year 969 marked the first successful trade compact between the holy kingdom and the algid city of Yin and marked the high point in the reign of Jasten&rsquo;s son Murdain.  Murdain passed away in human calendar year 986 leaving the kingdom in the hands of his son Esothan.<br>
