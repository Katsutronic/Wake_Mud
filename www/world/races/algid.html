    5'5&rdquo; to 6'10&rdquo; (5'11&rdquo;)<br>
	Algid skin tone is ranges from nearly transparent white to dusky blue.  Algid eye color typically shares a similar range as their skin tones including, white, silver, grey, blue, violet, and black, cases of either gold or green eyes have been noted but are treated as a rarity.  The Algid body type is typically lean, while not developing muscle volume to the degrees of their counter parts the Algid seem to make better use of the tissues they do develop.  The Algid people are typically restricted in habitat to cooler climates excelling in weather cold enough to kill the other races, in contrast however they do suffer physical weakness in the warmer seasons and are prone to death when exposed to the intense heat of desert conditions.  The Algid nation consists of multiple houses bowing down to an emperor called a &ldquo;Prime&rdquo; a seat which while technically hereditary may be challenged by any worthy citizen, upon winning such a contest the champion is appointed head of the ruling house.  Commonly refered to as brutal and uncivilized Algid society is based upon strict rules and codes prioritizing respect and honor as ultimate achievements.  The typical crimes that plague other societies, theft, vandalism, and rape are virtually unheard of withing the Algid culture, it is how ever a common sight to see sanctioned battles on side streets which often leave someone dead.  In keeping with this desire for strength and honor we seldom see elderly or deformed Algid citizens as their fellows are likely to exploit any weakness presented.  Due to this rather brutal form of retirement we see very few natural deaths in the Algid people preventing an accurate lifespan from being calculated.  In terms of religion the Algid have a very laid back approach given the living condition of their monstrous gods.  With four members in their pantheon the Algid principally worship only on specified holidays or when the nearest god look at them in terms of food.<br>
