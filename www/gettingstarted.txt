Greetings and welcome to the Getting Started section. This section is
designed to help you get started on our mud, even if you have never played
a Mud before.

Firstly, you must understand the nature of Muds. They are text based RPG's
(role playing games) that work similar to a table-top game or an MMORPG.
Unlike MMO's, Muds use words to describe the setting, characters and...
pretty much everything, as there are no graphics! You move around by typing
in commands like "look" to see the room or "north" to walk north. This is
(In our opinion) better than an MMO's graphics base because there is such
a higher level of customization of your character. You are able to describe
every detail of their appearance and outfit, and the world can be just as
vividly described. So long as you have the imagination to enjoy a book,
Muds will spring to life, offering an interactive environment where you can
team up to slay dragons, or engage others in deep, intense roleplaying.
