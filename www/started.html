	First and foremost welcome the wonderful world of Wake, if you 
have already read some of the other documentations under the "World" and 
"Game" sections of the site, then your probally ready to get started 
adventuring. If you are logging into Wake for the first time, or are new 
to mud gaming in general, here are some things you will need to know and 
expect:
<br><br>
<span class="header">Basics</span><br><br>
A MUD (multi-user dungeon), is an online game in which PC (player 
characters, thats you) interact with and within a virtual world 
described entirely in text. A player is able to read the description of 
the room he/she is in, as well as interact with any player, or NPC 
(non-character player also know as a mob), or object. They interect with 
their enviroment via commands, a list of common helpful commands to get 
you started can be found by typing HELP while connected in the game with 
your character.
<br><br>
<span class="header">Connecting </span><br><br>
All online text-based games require a client or telnet portal to connect 
to the game, the easiest way to connect to ours is by clicking the "Web 
Portal" link on the sidebar, this will load a telnet window that will 
automatically connect you to Wake. This route however limits your 
ability to customize your gaming experience, as stand alone clients 
offer a variety of utilities that enrich your game. 
<br><br>
Visit our <a href="community/links.html">Links</a> page for some suggested clients. <br><br>
And use the following connection information to get onto Wake!
<br><br>
TCP/IP Address: Wakemud.com
Port Number 2177
<br><br>
<span class="header">Creating A Character</span><br><br>
Once you have connected, the game will ask you for your character's name 
and a password to begin with. Make sure your password contains at least 
6 letters and 2 numbers as a guidline, to prevent someone from 
attempting to hack your character. Creating a character is very simple 
here at Wake, as there are just a few sections, and you should find that 
they are fairly easy to answer questions about your character. When you 
are finished it will ask you if you want to be transfered to the newbie 
school, note that even if you have played muds before it is recommended 
you take a look through the mud school as there are many changes to our 
mud that are differant from the many stock muds online. Once this is 
done you now have a living breathing character in our World. 
<br><br>
<span class="header">Getting Help</span><br><br>
Wake may at first may not seem quite like what most people are familiar 
with, and we understand this, so we try to make sure there are always 
available staff members to assist you in your journey. It is recommend 
that you leaf through the help files and game documents in the game, and 
possibly find your answer there first. Helpfiles are read by typing in 
"help <topic>", replacing <topic> with whatever you are looking for, 
"weapons", "classes", etc. Here is an important help file for newcomers 
to read foremost: 
<br><br>
HELP NEWBIE - An overview of how your character works including classes, 
skillpoints, and levels. And further help information.
<br><br>
If you have further questions, feel free to ask using the QUESTION or 
NEWBIE command, leaf through the other help files, or use the boards.  
Read HELP CHANNELS, and HELP NOTE for more information.
<br><br>
If all else fails, you can email us via one of the addresses supplied on 
the Community section under Staff.
