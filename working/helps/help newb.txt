Welcome to Phoenix, we hope your adventure with us is exciting
and fulfilling.
As a new member to the world, there are a few things that might
be useful to know, as this world is not quite like ones you
might be familiar with.
First and most importantly, remember there is a max level for
your class, and by the time you are hero level, you will have
been four classes. When you stop gaining experience from kills,
seek out the guildmaster for the class you wish to become to
change. Read HELP CHANGE, HELP CLASSES and HELP CLASSTREE
for more information.
Secondly, you will earn gain points at each level, these can be
used to buy whatever skills are available. Spend them how you
see fit, but be sure to use them all, for you cannot change
classes until you've expended all of your current gains. You
will notice some skills have pre-requisites. Try to gain one
of these skills to view what its pre-requisites are. Also be
aware that each skill has five levels, with each level increasing
the skill's potency. You can either choose to gain many skills
and be average at each, or master just a few skills, the choice
is yours.
