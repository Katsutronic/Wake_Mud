Priest Skills:
Level   1:  recall              Already Present!   
	    club                Increase your skill with club type weapons.
Level   2:  fast healing        Already Present!   
	    haggle              Already Present!
            kick                Already Present!   
	    punch               Punching allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful punch.  Mercenaries and monks are the most skilled at punching, although many other proffessions may also learn it.

            riding              Riding is a skill that allows the adventurers to make use of various mounts available for sale in the cities. (I'm assuming something along the lines of riding a mount will increase the distance you can travel as well as reduce the amount of time to get to the destination which will minimize the adventurers fatigue upon arrival.)
Level  10:  faith               Don't know what it does!   
	    first aid           First Aid is the skill which gives the adventurer the ability to heal minor wounds at the expense of the adventurer's own fatigue. This skill is not meant to heal serious wounds and wears the adventurer slowly as they heal wounds reducing the healers ability to travel long distances or make use of other tiring skills. Priests are the most accomplished, but anyone may attempt this skill with very little success.
            meditation          Already Prestent!
Level  25:  flail               Increases your skill with flail type weapons.   
	    quarterstaff        Increases your skill with quarterstaff type weapons.
            bandage             This skill is similar to First Aid but more potent. You will be able to heal slightly heavier wounds with more fatigue to the healer. Again, this skill is not meant to heal more than light wounds as it will fatigue the healer over long periods of use and should be used to heal only minor to light wounds.
	    sacred guardian     Sacred Guardian calls upon the holy powers of the priest to increase his resistances to opponents of the opposite alignment. This skill is invisible to the adventurer but will increase his armor against opponents of an opposite alignment at the same time decreasing the effectiveness of his opponents spells.
            dodge               Already Present!   
	    dogma               Similar to Sacred Guardian, Dogma uses the priests holy power to increase the power of his spells against opponents of an opposing alignment. This skill is invisible to the adventurer and should be noted it will only increase the effectivness of spells that do damage aligned with the casters alignment. Dogma will not increase the effectiveness of spells that deal evil damgae if the casters alignment is good.
Level  50:  hammer              Increase your skill with hammer type weapons.   
	    mace                Increase your skill with mace type weapons.
            staff               Increase your skill with staff type weapons.   
	    holy touch          Holy Touch is a skill to call upon holy powers to help heal wounds. This skill does not use mana but heals wounds significantly better than the First Aid skill. Similarly, it causes the healer to fatigue.
            piety               Piety gives the adventurer Faith based bonuses to spell cost, armor and damage for the servitude to their Gods. The skill reduces spell cost and damage taken while increasing armor and the damage of your spells.   
	    poverty             Bonus for having little money and possessions.
            reverence           A divine right bestowed upon the adventurer giving them the chance that healing spells cast by them can affect others in the room in need of healing. This would give the caster a slight chance to heal multiple targets when they only specified one target.
	    true belief         Believing wholly in their faith, this skill gives the adventurer a boost to the potency of their healing magics.
